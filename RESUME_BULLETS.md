# Resume Bullets for CIDA Project

## Option 1: Detailed (Recommended)
```
AI-Powered Document Intelligence Platform | Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React, Google Gemini API | [Date]

• Architected a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system enabling semantic document search and AI-powered Q&A with 
  cosine similarity-based chunk retrieval and vector embeddings.

• Implemented secure document processing pipeline with JWT authentication, bcrypt password hashing, and comprehensive 
  audit logging for compliance and security tracking.

• Built RESTful API with Express.js handling document upload, text extraction, chunking, and real-time AI summarization 
  using Google Gemini API integration.

• Developed React frontend with dynamic PDF preview, real-time chat interface, and typing animations for enhanced 
  user experience in document interaction workflows.
```

## Option 2: More Technical Focus
```
Cloud Intelligent Document Assistant (CIDA) | MERN Stack, RAG, Vector Embeddings, Google Gemini API | [Date]

• Designed and implemented a RAG-powered document intelligence system with semantic search using cosine similarity 
  calculations and vector embeddings for context-aware document retrieval.

• Built scalable document processing pipeline with PDF text extraction, intelligent chunking (1200 char chunks with 
  150 char overlap), and asynchronous processing for handling large document volumes.

• Integrated Google Gemini API for document summarization and Q&A, implementing fallback mechanisms and error handling 
  for resilient AI-powered features.

• Developed secure authentication system with JWT tokens, role-based access control (RBAC), and audit event tracking 
  for compliance and security monitoring.
```

## Option 3: Concise (If space is limited)
```
AI Document Intelligence Platform | Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React, RAG, Google Gemini API | [Date]

• Built RAG-powered document Q&A system with semantic search using vector embeddings and cosine similarity for 
  intelligent document retrieval and context-aware responses.

• Implemented secure document processing pipeline with JWT auth, PDF extraction, chunking, and AI summarization 
  with comprehensive audit logging.
```

## Option 4: Impact-Focused
```
AI-Powered Document Intelligence Platform | MERN Stack, RAG, Vector Search, Google Gemini API | [Date]

• Engineered a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system that transforms documents into queryable knowledge bases, 
  enabling natural language Q&A with page-level citations and semantic understanding.

• Developed secure, production-ready document management system with JWT authentication, role-based access control, 
  and complete audit trail for enterprise compliance requirements.

• Integrated Google Gemini API for intelligent document summarization and context-aware question answering, reducing 
  document analysis time from hours to seconds for end users.
```

## Option 5: Full Stack Emphasis
```
Full-Stack AI Document Intelligence Platform | Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React, RAG, Google Gemini API | [Date]

• Architected full-stack MERN application with RAG-powered semantic search, implementing vector embeddings, cosine 
  similarity calculations, and intelligent document chunking for context-aware retrieval.

• Built secure backend API with Express.js featuring JWT authentication, bcrypt password hashing, file upload handling 
  with Multer, and comprehensive error handling with rate limiting and security headers.

• Developed responsive React frontend with dynamic PDF preview, real-time AI chat interface, typing animations, and 
  optimized UI/UX for seamless document interaction workflows.

## Tips for Customization:

1. **Match the Job Description**: Emphasize technologies mentioned in the job posting
2. **Quantify When Possible**: Add metrics if you have them (e.g., "processed 1000+ documents", "handled 50+ concurrent users")
3. **Use Action Verbs**: Designed, Architected, Implemented, Built, Developed, Engineered
4. **Show Impact**: Focus on what the system does and why it matters
5. **Keep It Concise**: Each bullet should be 1-2 lines max

## Example with Metrics (if you have them):
```
AI-Powered Document Intelligence Platform | Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React, RAG, Google Gemini API | [Date]

• Architected RAG system processing 500+ documents with semantic search using vector embeddings and cosine similarity, 
  enabling sub-second query responses for document Q&A workflows.

• Implemented secure document processing pipeline with JWT authentication and audit logging, handling 1000+ document 
  uploads with 99.9% processing success rate.

• Built React frontend with real-time AI chat interface, reducing document analysis time by 80% through intelligent 
  summarization and context-aware Q&A features.
```
